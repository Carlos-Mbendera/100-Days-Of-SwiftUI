// INTEGERS




//When creating Integer, you can use underscores to break up numbers similar to a comma in real life
// For exacple

let bigNoSpacesNumber = 100000000000000

//Integer Edits

var counter = 231
counter += 14
print(counter)
// Basically the same as counter = counter + 5
//Just put a different sign like *,/,- and it will do it to the variable

// You can also check if something is a multiple like so
let testNumber = 10
print(testNumber.isMultiple(of: 2))
//OR
print(10.isMultiple(of: 2))


//DECIMAL NUMBERS

let num = 0.1 + 0.2
